# gb_app
A react native application to store a user's golf scores.  
The app provides a way to add information about a round of golf such as the course, score, weather, greens in regulation and fairways hit.
A mapview component is also available to see where each course played is located.
There is also a way to store data about each club, such as longest drive, average distance with a 7 iron, etc.

The app uses firebase authentication for logging in, and a firestore db to store all data for users.
